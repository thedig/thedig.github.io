<h3> Dig Vargas</h3>

<p> After spending some time teaching myself Ruby, Rails, Javascript and Backbone.js, I am very excited to jump into a web development role. I enjoy tinkering with code and building out web applications. I have made several Ruby terminal programs, Rails applications and more interaction based projects leveraging jQuery and Backbone.js and am totally pumped for the opportunity to contribute to some challenging projects.

I am a very committed and motivated worker and my 6 years experience in the online advertising world gives me an understanding of how to interface with clients, coordinate across departments for product initiatives and to maintain focus on the business goals. Between my commitment to quality work, delivery for the client and a serious passion for programming I can deliver for a team looking to make a solid product both for the end user and the company.
